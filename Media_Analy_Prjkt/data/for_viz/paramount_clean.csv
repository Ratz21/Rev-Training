When the time to present a humorous punch-line approaches, Benson interrupted the comic with a comment with the intent of adding to the humor of the joke.

The show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, roughly during the 2260s. The crew is headed by Captain James T. Kirk, first officer Spock, and chief medical officer Leonard McCoy. Shatner's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose:

The series was produced from 1966-67 by Desilu Productions, and by Paramount Television from 1968-69. Star Trek aired on NBC from September 8, 1966 to June 3, 1969. Although this television series had the title of Star Trek, it later acquired the retronym of Star Trek: The Original Series to distinguish the show within the media franchise that it began. Star Trek's Nielsen ratings while on NBC were low, and the network canceled it after three seasons and 79 episodes. Nevertheless, the show had a major influence on popular culture and it became a cult classic in broadcast syndication during the 1970s. The show eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, toys, and other products.","1966","['scifi', 'drama', 'action']","['US']","3.0","tt0060028","8.4","86240.0","153.183","8.09","50"

In T.I.'s Road to Redemption, T.I. shares the mistakes he has madeand the lessons he learned. The show includes events in his personal life such as the birth of his sixth son and the release of his album, Paper Trail.

In 2007, T.I. was convicted of two felony gun charges. He served a sentence of one year and one day behind bars starting March 27, 2009. He was also sentenced to 1500 hours of community service. The series started filming in June 2008 continued until March 2009.

\"We visited T.I. early in 2008 while he was under house arrest in Georgia and found a man utterly unlike his rap persona,\" Stella Stolper and Michael Hirschorn of Ish Entertainment said. \"He felt that he was undergoing a karmic reckoning, a time when he would have to balance the scales of his life and integrate who he was with who he is.

It originally started as a short segment that came near the end of the original Blue's Clues show, originally cast off as Blue's personal imaginary world once Joe took over the show after his brother Steve \"went to college\". Later on, when Joe also decided to leave the show Blue's Clues, the short segment became a show itself, with Joe appearing in some episodes.

What distinguishes Blue's Room from Blue's Clues is that Blue herself transforms from an animated blue puppy into an English-speaking puppet that directly interacts with the child with open ended questions or asks if a presented idea or solution is correct. The Season One episode \"Meet Blue's Baby Brother\" is a turnaround episode for this series, bringing most of the concepts of Blue's Clues into the new series and getting additional interest in the series.","2004","['animation', 'comedy', 'family']","['US']","2.0","tt4650130","6.9","179.0","2.365","5.0","24"

The show was the creation of producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 24, 1973. One of the longest-running series on television, the show chalked up seventeen seasons on CBS before entering first-run syndication for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.

The show's first ten seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a small farming community. Fictional eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness with a succession of United States Forest Service Rangers. After traveling without human leads for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.

Lassie received critical favor at its debut and won two Emmy Awards in its first years. Stars Jan Clayton and June Lockhart were nominated for Emmys. Merchandise produced during the show's run included books, a Halloween costume, clothing, toys, and other items. Campbell's Soup, the show's lifelong sponsor, offered two premiums, and distributed thousands to fans. A multi-part episode was edited into the feature film Lassie's Great Adventure and released in August 1963. In 1989, the television series The New Lassie brought Lassie star Jon Provost back to television as Steve McCullough. Selected episodes have been released to DVD.","1954","['action', 'drama', 'family']","['US']","19.0","tt0046617","6.5","3526.0","41.98","6.322","30"

Producers Angela Santomero, Todd Kessler and Traci Paige Johnson combined concepts from child development and early-childhood education with innovative animation and production techniques that helped their viewers learn. It was hosted originally by Steve Burns, who left in 2002 to pursue a music career, and later by Donovan Patton. Burns was a crucial reason for the show's success, and rumors that surrounded his departure were an indication of the show's emergence as a cultural phenomenon. Blue's Clues became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called \"one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking preschool television series of all time\". A spin-off called Blue's Room premiered in 2004.

The show's producers and creators presented material in narrative format instead of the more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. They revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show, and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers, and resembled a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting was familiar to American children, but had a look unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.","1996","['animation', 'comedy', 'family']","['US']","7.0","tt0163929","6.9","6187.0","37.565","7.789","25"

The series, produced by DIC Entertainment and originally airing on NBC, re-imagined Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Jughead Jones, Reggie Mantle, and the other teenage students of Riverdale High School as pre-teens in junior high. Fourteen episodes of the show were produced, which all aired during the show's first and only season in 1987 and were repeated in 1989. A short-lived Archie Comics series was produced bearing the same title and set in the same universe as the animated series. Reruns of the series ran on The Family Channel's Saturday morning lineup, 1991 to 1993 and on Toon Disney from 1998 to 2002.

In this series Veronica speaks like a valley girl. However, in previous animated cartoons and the radio show, she had a southern accent. Dilton Doiley was replaced as the \"intellectual\" character by an African American named Eugene. Eugene's girlfriend Amani was another addition to the cast.

The show's format is that of educational PBS children's television shows such as Sesame Street and The Electric Company, parodying the format with adult-oriented content. In addition to general controversial comedy, it satirizes politics, religion, war, sex, and culture with black comedy.

Every episode begins with a disclaimer, accompanied by the sound of someone screaming \"Don't eat my baby!\", which reads:

\"Wonder Showzen contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children.

Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: \"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\"

The series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD. All eight seasons are also now available by streaming video services such as Netflix.","1960","['comedy', 'family']","['US']","8.0","tt0053479","8.4","15615.0","63.313","7.69","29"

It was known for its excessive amount of blood used in every match and exaggerated physical injuries.

The series was created by Eric Fogel; with the pilots airing on MTV on January 1 & 25 1998. The initial series ran from May 14, 1998 to October 20, 2002, and lasted for a 75-episode run. There was one special that did not contribute to the final episode total, entitled \"Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany\", which aired on June 21, 2001. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin gave voice to his animated form as the guest commentator. Early in 2003, a film based on the series was announced by MTV to be in the making, but the project was canceled by the end of that year.

In 2005, MTV2 announced the revival of the show as part of their \"Sic 'Em Friday\" programming block. Originally set to return in November 2005, the premiere was pushed back to June 10, 2006 as part of a new \"Sic'emation\" block with two other animated shows, Where My Dogs At and The Adventures of Chico and Guapo. The show's fifth season was produced by Cuppa Coffee Studios and the premiere drew over 2.5 million viewers, becoming MTV2's highest rated season premiere ever.","1998","['comedy', 'sport', 'animation', 'action']","['US']","6.0","tt0208614","6.9","11528.0","13.772","7.569","21"

On the show they play brothers who live together in a strange house with a variety of unusual rooms. The show premiered on Nick Jr. Australia in August 2006 and on Noggin US on 16 October 2006, with 13 episodes developed by the highly acclaimed Sesame Workshop. The Sesame Workshop logo used on this show can only be seen on Noggin.

Initial views of The Upside Down Show were disappointing, as it failed to match the views of Play With Me Sesame and Caillou during the 2006-2007 season. The show's début was criticized as being similar to Ernie and Bert.

On 27 December 2006, in a New York Post interview, Shane Dundas expressed doubts about the return of the show for a second season.

On 1 June 2007, the Umbilical Brothers announced on their website that Nickelodeon/Noggin USA were not interested in a third season of The Upside Down Show, despite its success. In 2007, the show won the Creative Craft Daytime Emmy Award for Main Title Design and a Parents' Choice Award Silver Honor for Television.","2005","['comedy', 'family']","['US', 'AU']","7.0","tt0819085","8.7","799.0","2.33","8.5","25"

It was based on the 1986 book, Salute Your Shorts: Life at Summer Camp by Steve Slavkin.

The series, filmed at Franklin Canyon Park and the Griffith Park Boys Camp within Griffith Park in Los Angeles, was set at the summer camp Camp Anawanna. It focuses on teenage campers, their strict and bossy counselor, and the various capers and jocularities they engage in.

The title comes from a common prank campers play on each other: a group of kids steals a boy's boxer shorts and raise them up a flagpole. Hence, when people see them waving like a flag, other kids would salute them as part of the prank.","1991","['drama', 'comedy', 'family', 'romance']","['US']","2.0","tt0101190","8.3","5800.0","2.052","8.1","27"

An Ocean Mystery: The Missing Catch follows the work of the world's premier fisheries scientist, Dr. Daniel Pauly, as he investigates how close we are to a global crash in fish populations. It's a detective story that ranges from the Atlantic coastline to the reefs of the Bahamas and the shores of Senegal. Along the way Dr. Pauly and his team make startling discoveries about the impact of black market fisheries, the recreational fishing industry and more. And with 3 billion people around the world dependent on fish for protein it's one of the most important stories of our time. As government and industry regulators track the quantity of fish we catch, and claim the oceans can handle the huge catches, fish numbers keep dropping. Dr. Pauly's research shows that we have drastically underestimated the amount fish we catch globally and that we are running out of fish much faster than we thought. This film is a call to arms for governments around the world to take a better accounting of their fish stocks before we face a global food catastrophe.","2016","['documentation']","['BS', 'CA', 'HN', 'SN', 'US']","","tt6287796","8.6","9.0","0.6","","46"

To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack. Practically being raised by her extended family, Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, she's got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness. After she catches on to her father's plan, Tennie realizes that in order to get her father off of her back, she needs to convince him to find a lady friend. She recruits her friends to create an online dating profile in order to introduce her father to potential companions. Little did she know that her father already was seeing someone that he was not yet ready to introduce to her. Things escalate when Robert gets Tennie's friends from school to participate in a focus group for a project, and in retaliation, Tennie throws a party at the house with almost half of the school showing up. A series of hilarious interactions between father and daughter ensues that starts to close the generational gap between them. What finally brings them together is a long overdue heart to heart conversation about past transgressions. One thing becomes certain, they will always have each other.","2019","['comedy']","['US']","","tt10379006","4.4","127.0","1.342","5.5","94"

It was the second-most-watched show on UPN's Monday night line-up and fourth overall on the network. The show was on The CW's first draft line-up in March 2006, but due to several circumstances—including The CW's contractual obligation to pick up Reba, the uncancelling of All of Us, and the pick-up of the Girlfriends spin-off The Game—Half & Half was left off the final Fall 2006 schedule and ended production. The series has aired in reruns on Global TV in Canada, Trouble in the UK and in local syndication in the United States.

It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film Madagascar: The penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico; the lemurs King Julien, Maurice, and Mort; and Mason and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.

A pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", aired as part of \"Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.

Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place \"not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\"","2008","['comedy', 'animation', 'family', 'scifi', 'action']","['US']","3.0","tt0892700","7.5","19832.0","72.252","7.438","21"
