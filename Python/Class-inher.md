college -> Studdetail -> Studexcurr 



we have implemented inheritance over here multiple inheritance and super method in deep and having import object from the college class to teacher class which the base class here 



-> why dont we use super() in multiple inheritance 

-> part of which is PY uses MRO METHOD RESOLUTION ORDER IT BASICALLY TELLS US WHICH PARENT METHOD GETS CALLED FIRST 







#### ->>>>method overloading :

py doesn't support compile time polymorphism 



\*-> what is right lock and dead locks in py



#### **Exception handling** 

try 

except`

else

finally

raise
