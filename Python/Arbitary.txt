Kwargs and arbitrary in Py ->

In Python, you can create functions that don’t know beforehand how many arguments they’ll receive.

That’s what arbitrary arguments are — they let your function handle any number of values (positional or keyword).

| Type                     | Symbol     | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Arbitrary positional** | `*args`    | accepts *any number of positional arguments* |
| **Arbitrary keyword**    | `**kwargs` | accepts *any number of keyword arguments*    |

* Modules
if i write more than one class in one prg is called module. A module is just a single .py file that contains Python code — functions, classes, variables, or executable statements — which can be imported and reused in another file. Modules help with code reusability and organization.You can import entire modules or just specific parts.
