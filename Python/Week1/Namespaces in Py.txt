Namespaces in Py ------------------

A namespace is just a collection of names (identifiers) mapped to objects in memory.
{
  'x': 10,
  'y': 'Rajdeep'
}

(So when Python sees x, it goes:
 that label points to the integer 10.
Thats all a namespace is â€” a map from names to objects )

namespace is a container thats hold a mapping between names identifiers and objects it helps avoid naming conflicts.

| Namespace Type | Scope                   | Lifetime                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Built-in**   | Available everywhere    | As long as Python runs         |
| **Global**     | Whole module or file    | Until program ends             |
| **Enclosing**  | Inside nested functions | While outer function is active |
| **Local**      | Inside a function       | While function runs            |
