Binary data ->>>>>>>>>>>



Binary data in Python is represented using the bytes and bytearray data types.



bytes is immutable, while bytearray is mutable, allowing modification of binary data.



Binary data can be encoded and decoded using different character encodings like UTF-8, ASCII, etc.



Understanding how to work with binary data is essential for file I/O operations, network communication, and low-level data processing in Python.
